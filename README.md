# Credit Card Financial Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive Credit Card Financial Analysis Dashboard developed using Power BI and SQL. The dashboard provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to effectively monitor and analyze credit card operations.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation
- **SQL**: For data storage and complex queries
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For custom calculations and metrics

## Key Features
1. **Weekly Status Report**: Tracks week-on-week changes in key metrics
2. **Customer Segmentation**: Analyzes customer behavior based on age and income groups
3. **Revenue Analysis**: Breaks down revenue sources including annual fees, transaction amounts, and interest earned
4. **Transaction Monitoring**: Tracks total transaction amounts and patterns
5. **Card Type Performance**: Evaluates performance of different credit card types
6. **Geographical Analysis**: Identifies top-performing states and regions

## Data Processing
- Data imported from CSV files into SQL database
- Custom DAX queries created for advanced calculations and grouping
